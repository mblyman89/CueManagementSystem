# Raspberry Pi Zero W2 Access Point Setup for MacBook Pro

This repository contains comprehensive documentation and configuration files for setting up a Raspberry Pi Zero W2 as a WiFi access point for connecting with a MacBook Pro.

## Project Overview

The Raspberry Pi Zero W2 can be configured as a standalone WiFi access point, allowing devices like a MacBook Pro to connect directly to it. This setup is useful for:

- Creating a local network in areas without WiFi
- Establishing a direct connection for file transfers or remote control
- Setting up a portable development environment
- Creating an isolated network for testing or security purposes

## Quick Start Guide

1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite to a microSD card
2. Set up SSH access for headless operation
3. Connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH
4. Update the system: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
5. Install required packages: `sudo apt install hostapd dnsmasq -y`
6. Follow the detailed instructions in [setup_instructions.md](setup_instructions.md)

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Zero W2
- MicroSD card (8GB or larger)
- Power supply for Raspberry Pi (minimum 1.2A recommended)
- MacBook Pro with WiFi capability

## Key Features

- **Standalone Access Point**: Creates a dedicated WiFi network
- **DHCP Server**: Automatically assigns IP addresses to connected devices
- **Persistent Configuration**: Maintains settings across reboots
- **Optional Internet Sharing**: Can share internet from another interface
- **Secure Connection**: WPA2 encryption for secure wireless communication
- **Optimized for MacBook Pro**: Tested and configured for optimal compatibility

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup or operation, refer to the [troubleshooting_guide.md](troubleshooting_guide.md) for detailed solutions to common problems.

## Maintenance

For best practices on maintaining your Raspberry Pi access point, refer to the [maintenance_guide.md](maintenance_guide.md).

## Technical Approach

After researching both ad-hoc network and access point approaches, we determined that setting up the Raspberry Pi Zero W2 as a WiFi access point provides better compatibility with modern MacBook Pro systems and offers a more stable connection. For details on this decision, see [approach_comparison.md](approach_comparison.md).

## Network Configuration

The access point is configured with the following network settings:
- SSID: PiZeroAP
- IP Address: 192.168.4.1
- DHCP Range: 192.168.4.2 - 192.168.4.20
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

For more details, see [network_configuration.md](network_configuration.md).

## Security Considerations

- The default configuration uses WPA2 encryption
- Default password should be changed during setup
- MAC filtering can be enabled for additional security
- Regular security updates are recommended
